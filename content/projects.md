# Projects

I greatly enjoy the opportunities and varied experiences that a portfolio career offers. No week will ever look quite the same, and I have the fantastic opportunity to meet so many wonderful, talented people along the way.

## Testimonials

Here is a short selection of testimonials left by a few of my clients:

>  "If you are looking for professionalism, enthusiasm and proficiency in the curation of your music project, look no further than Josh Quinlan! Josh has already amassed a wealth of experience as a music engraver, sound recordist and singer in the music industry. With this experience comes a passion and determination to ensure the highest quality, not only with the end result but in the whole process. Josh is gregarious, approachable and dedicated, and you will enjoy planning and executing any music project with him." 
> 
> ~ [Ben Parry](https://www.benparry.net/) (Director, London Voices)

> "Josh's highly organised production skills, clear communication, and positive and engaging approach to working relationships have been a huge asset to the multiple projects I have worked on with him, both in his capacity as a producer and engraver. He is quick to respond and I felt confident that I was in safe hands!" 
>
> ~ [Jamie Wright](https://jamie-wright.co.uk/) (Baritone, The Swingles)

> "I mostly know Josh Quinlanâ€˜s work through his singing and engraving. Both are first class: the singing accurate, well-blended and expressive, and the engraving superb." 
>
> ~ [Ralph Allwood MBE](https://ralphallwood.com/) (Conductor)

> "Josh is an artist with multiple strings to his bow. In particular, his producing and engraving work for National Youth Choir has been (and continues to be) of an exceptional standard."

## Useful Tools

I am a strong advocate of the free and open source software (FOSS) movement, and therefore endeavour to make many of the tools that I use on a daily basis available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/DonQuinleone) account. This includes applications like my **TakeLogger** and various other scripts that are useful in all kinds of scenarios.
